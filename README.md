# McdonaldML
In my notebook, I do a thorough study of McDonald's shop evaluations, utilising sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques, including the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithm. 
This project's purpose is to forecast the emotion conveyed in the reviews and acquire important insights into consumer perspectives. I explore the field of sentiment analysis using a large dataset gathered from Kaggle that includes a wide spectrum of consumer comments. 
I assure the accuracy of my sentiment analysis model's performance by separating the dataset into training and test sets.
